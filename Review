Q1 What’s the difference between an indexed array and an associative array?
A An indexed array is indexed with numbers:

  $indexed = array("one", "two", "three");
  $indexed = array(1 => "one", 2 => "two", 3 => "three");

  while associative arrays are indexed by strings:

  $marks = array("Mark" => 80, "June" => 77, "April" => "95");

Q2 When should you use quotation marks for an array’s key or value? When
   shouldn’t you?
A Quotation marks should be used for array keys or values when the key
  or value is a string.

Q3 How do you print a specific array element? How do you print every
   element in an array?
A  You can print a specific array element by accessing the array using
   the appropriate key value.

   For example, the following command will print the first value of
   an indexed array:

   print "day[0]";

   while the following command will print the value from the "marks"
   associative array corresponding to the key 'June':

   print "marks['June']";

Q4 What happens if you don’t use the square brackets when adding an
   element to an array?
A  It will replace the array with a string whose value is the element
   being added to the former array.

Q5 What function returns the number of elements in an array?
A  The count() function returns the number of elements in an array.

Q6 When must you use curly brackets for printing array elements?
A  Curly braces are required for printing array elements when the keys
   are strings. They can also be used to clarify the syntax of variable
   references

Q7 What is the difference between the sort() and asort() functions?
   Between sort() and rsort()?

   The sort() function sorts the values of an array, replacing the existing
   keys with new keys.

   The asort() function sorts the values of an array, preserving the existing
   keys.

   Sort() performs an ascending sort, while rsort() performs a descending
   sort.

Q8 What is the syntax for explode()? For implode()? If you don’t remember,
   check out the PHP manual page for either function.

   The syntax of the explode function is:

   array = explode(delimeter_string, string);

   The syntax of the implode function is:

   string = implode(glue_string, array_of_pieces_to_glue);
